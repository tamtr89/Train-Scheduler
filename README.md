<h1>Project Tittle: 
Train Scheduler</h1>


<h4>In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.</h4>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
<li>Train Name</li>
<li>Destination </li>
<li>First Train Time -- in military time</li>
<l>Frequency -- in minutes</li>
<li>Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.</li>
<li>Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.</li>
<li>Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!</li>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS Bootstrap</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>jQuery for Dom Manipulation</li>
<li>Firebase</li>
<li>Moment.js<li>
