<h1>Project Tittle: Train Scheduler</h1>
In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

<h4>This app displays buttons related to a certain topic and allows you to add search terms to generate additional buttons that when clicked, accesses the GIPHY API and generates 10 static GIPHY images. Click on an image to pause or play the GIF.</h4>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Accepts user input to add new train name, start time and frequency to schedule. Displays schedule in repeating table with next arrival based on current time and frequency of train stops. Stores Train info in Firebase for data persistence and retreives information from database on load. Schedules refresh every minute to reflect updated arrival information. User can delete train information from schedule and database with click of button.
